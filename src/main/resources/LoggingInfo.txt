Use by doing log.'level' (e.g. log.info('message')) or log.log('level', 'message')

TRACE (600): this is the least severe log level,
             typically used to log fine-grained
             information about a program's execution
             such as entering or exiting functions,
             and variable values, and other low-level
             details that can help in understanding the
             internal workings of your code.
DEBUG (500): it is used for logging messages intended
             to be helpful during the development and
             testing process,which is usually program
             state information that can be helpful when
             ascertaining whether an operation is being
             performed correctly.
INFO (400): it is used for informational messages that
            record events that occur during the normal
            operation of your application, such as user
            authentication, API calls, or database access.
            These messages help you understand what's
            happening within your application.
WARN (300): events logged at this level indicate potential
            issues that might require your attention before
            they become significant problems.
ERROR (200): it is used to record unexpected errors that
             occur during the course of program execution.
FATAL (100): this is the most severe log level, and it
             indicates an urgent situation affecting your
             application's core component that should be
             addressed immediately.
